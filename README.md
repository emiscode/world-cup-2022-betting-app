# World Cup 2022 Betting App

## Bet on the winner of each match

This project is the result of my participation on the **NLW Copa 2022** event, hosted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br). The main goal is to improve my skills in programming, using technologies from both backend and frontend, such as **Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, SQLite, React, React Native, Next, Expo and Tailwind.**
